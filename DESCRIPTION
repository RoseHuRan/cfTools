Description: cfTools is a versatile toolset of deconvoluting the cell-free DNA fragments 
    (or sequencing reads) into multiple tissue types or tumor types. It can deconvolute 
    the different sources of cfDNA sequencing reads in two contexts: (1) separating reads 
    into tumor-derived reads and background reads; and (2) separating the reads from 
    different tissues.
